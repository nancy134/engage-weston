Finding the best sites for the water tanks has been one of the most difficult parts of the water tank replacement process. Early on, the engineers determined that the best locations for the new water tanks were near the top of the same hills that the existing water tanks are on, e.g., Paine's Hill, Doublet Hill, and Cat Rock. These hills have two major advantages for water tanks: they are the highest points in Weston, and they are distributed across the Town, allowing for efficient water delivery to residents. Due to the overwhelming advantages of these three hilltops, no other tank locales were considered.

While it was easy to confirm that the existing tanks were already in the best places, picking the exact location for the new tanks at these three hills was a challenge. The existing tanks are located on postage-stamp-sized lots that are not big enough to accommodate a second tank. (In order to have a safe and reliable water system while the new tanks are constructed, the old tanks must remain in service until the new tanks are built.)

Fortunately for the Town, all three tanks are adjacent to conservation land. The previous working group, consisting of Select Board member Laurie Bent, Town Manager Leon Gaumond, DPW Director Tom Cullen, as well as other members of DPW staff, and Wright-Pierce engineers Rob Williamson and Amy Coppers, soon understood that the best option for the Town was to site the new tanks on conservation land. However, conservation land is protected under Article 97 of the Massachusetts Constitution. Converting such land to use for water tanks requires a lengthy public process that involves exchanging, or swapping, the conservation land being appropriated as water supply land in return for new conservation land elsewhere in the Town. If the Town wants to take conservation land and use it for water supply purposes, it must follow a careful process called MEPA (short for Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act). The proposed new conservation land, which is currently municipal land, must have an equal or greater value to the land that is being taken out of conservation, measured as acreage, economic value, and conservation value.

The Select Board held public site walks at each of the three hills in late May and early June, 2023. Participants included neighborhood residents, who had been provided with hand- delivered letters notifying them of the site walk. Other attendees included members of the Select Board, the Town Manager, representatives of DPW, Planning Board, Conservation Commission, Tree Advisory Group, the Town Engineer, and Wright-Pierce. Comments received
during the site walks were used to develop criteria for evaluating tank locations based on the comprehensive needs and concerns of the community, including residents as well as Town departments, boards, and committees.

To meet MEPA requirements, the Town must show that it has no better alternative than to site the tanks on conservation land. The process must take all potential siting alternatives into account. Based on the input it had received from participants at the site walks, Wright-Pierce, in close consultation with the working group and the Conservation Commission, developed an “Alternatives Analysis.” The Alternatives Analysis is a matrix of considerations that had to be balanced in determining the final site for each water tank1.

The Alternatives Analysis considered competing concerns of impacts to conservation land, impact on residential abutters, engineering challenges, and cost. Minimizing the impact to conservation land that provides wildlife habitat, recreational benefits, and valued landmarks is important. Another consideration is that some abutters may be adversely impacted by a new tank in a slightly different location than the old one; at the same time, a tank location that is better for one abutter may be worse for others. Each particular location presents unique challenges of site preparation, including cut and fill, if the site isn’t level; the requirement that the site be accessible for large machines, how much risk constructing a tank at the site may pose to existing infrastructure, and the difficulty of construction. Cost to construct is another important variable: the Town owes taxpayers a duty to use public funds prudently.

The Alternatives Analysis quantified these competing considerations so that the sites could be compared. Thirteen concerns were divided into categories and given overall weights:

Finding the best sites for the water tanks has been one of the most difficult parts of the water tank replacement process.

Based on the input it had received from participants at the site walks, Wright-Pierce, in close consultation with the working group and the Conservation Commission, developed an “Alternatives Analysis.” The Alternatives Analysis is a matrix of considerations that had to be balanced in determining the final site for each water tank1.

The Alternatives Analysis considered competing concerns of impacts to conservation land, impact on residential abutters, engineering challenges, and cost. Minimizing the impact to conservation land that provides wildlife habitat, recreational benefits, and valued landmarks is important. Another consideration is that some abutters may be adversely impacted by a new tank in a slightly different location than the old one; at the same time, a tank location that is better for one abutter may be worse for others. Each particular location presents unique challenges of site preparation, including cut and fill, if the site isn’t level; the requirement that the site be accessible for large machines, how much risk constructing a tank at the site may pose to existing infrastructure, and the difficulty of construction. Cost to construct is another important variable: the Town owes taxpayers a duty to use public funds prudently.

The Alternatives Analysis quantified these competing considerations so that the sites could be compared. Thirteen concerns were divided into categories and given overall weights:

1. impacts to conservation land (weighted at 38 points out of 100);
2. impacts to abutters (weighted at 22 points out of 100);
3. engineering challenges (weighted at 34 points out of 100);
4. cost (weighted at 6 points out of 100).

Each site was scored on all criteria, and then compared to the other sites under consideration. (For more information about the weighting process, and the results of the scoring, see the November 27, 2023 Alternatives Analysis.)

Notably, the results of the analysis were not sensitive to different weightings. In the November Alternatives Analysis, the same sites received the highest scores at all three hills (Paine's Hill, Doublet Hill, and Cat Rock) even when the weighting was adjusted to give 50% of the total weight to “impacts to abutters,” or to “impacts to preserved land,” or to “engineering.” The results also held up with weighting divided equally between abutters, conservation land, and engineering.

In the case of both Doublet Hill and Paine's Hill, the new tanks are proposed to be located further from the nearest residences than the old tanks. This is not to minimize the impact on abutters of new tanks that will be approximately 40 feet higher than the old tanks, but at least the tanks could be located further away from residences than the existing tanks are.

Unfortunately, there is no location at the Cat Rock site that would move the tanks further from all existing residences without impacting the Cat Rock lookout, (immediately north of the existing tank) with its northerly views, since residences surround the Cat Rock hill to the east, south, and west. That is why siting the Cat Rock site has been particularly difficult.2

The Alternatives Analysis was published on the Town website on November 27, 2023. This analysis included a second site at Cat Rock that was proposed by Mr. Michael Chasan, an abutter. At its meeting on December 5, 2023 the Select Board spent about an hour and a quarter hearing the Wright-Pierce presentation on the analysis, including the adjustments that had been made to minimize impacts to abutters, and discussing the question of tank sites. A second Cat Rock site walk took place on January 5, in response to Mr. Chasan’s dissatisfaction with the two existing Cat Rock alternatives (one of which he had proposed). After the January 5th site walk, Mr. Chasan submitted another Cat Rock site, Alternative #3, which he preferred to Alternative #2 that he had previously identified.

At its January 23, 2024 meeting, the Select Board spent about 2 hours discussing the Cat Rock siting, including hearing lengthy presentations by Mr. Chasan’s attorney and engineer. During discussion, Mr. Chasan’s Alternative #3 was not viewed favorably, in part because it would encroach on the Cat Rock lookout, was too close to the existing tank for safety during construction, and would cost an additional $1 to $1.5M to construct. In light of the lack of enthusiasm for Alternative #3, the Select Board postponed its vote on the Cat Rock site so that Mr. Chasan could make the case for his previous proposal, Alternative #2. After further discussion on Doublet Hill and Paine's Hill sites, the Select Board voted on these two sites.

The Select Board took up the Cat Rock siting decision again at its February 27, 2024 meeting. The Select Board discussed Mr. Chasan’s proposed new Alternative #2A (whose location differed slightly from Alternative #2), for nearly two hours, with input from Mr. Chasan’s attorney and engineer as well as from Wright-Pierce and townspeople. After a careful comparison of Alternative Site #1 and Alternative Site #2A, the Select Board voted to approve Alternative Site #1 as the site for the Cat Rock water tank.

With regard to siting, as with all aspects of the Water Tank process, the Select Board took care to conduct a thoughtful and fair process, as required not just by MEPA but by our duty to be good stewards of the Town’s interests, making sure all perspectives were represented. (Wright- Pierce has been in touch with the MEPA Office throughout the water tank siting process, to ensure that the Town’s process is in accordance with MEPA requirements.) The Select Board’s
siting decision at Cat Rock was particularly difficult because it involved weighing competing considerations. At Cat Rock, a site that is better for one abutter is worse for another. Impacts to conservation land, as well as considerations of constructability, safety, and cost had to be taken into account. We did our best to accommodate the competing interests, but at Cat Rock, there is no perfect site. Ultimately, the Town’s need for a safe and functional water system that will serve the entire Town must be the most important consideration of all.

Search for the Document Center link on the right side of the page, and select “tank siting.” Here, among other documents, you will find two analyses that informed the siting process. One Alternatives Analysis is dated November 27, 2023 and is titled “Final Report: Tank Site Alternatives Analysis.” There is also a later alternatives analysis document, dated February 2024, under the header “Weston Water Tanks Meeting.” Note that the February 2024 Alternatives Analysis addresses only the Cat Rock siting location (see footnote below).

2 The Cat Rock siting process required an additional alternatives analysis summarized in the February 24, 2024 document. An abutter at the Cat Rock location had proposed a total of three alternative sites to the one proposed by Wright-Pierce. One of the abutter’s proposed sites was addressed in the November 27, 2023 alternatives analysis. Two additional sites were evaluated in the February 2024 analysis.
