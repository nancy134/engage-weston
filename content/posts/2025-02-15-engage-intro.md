Welcome to **Engage Weston!** We are a new group of Weston resident volunteers dedicated to sharing accurate, transparent, timely information on the issues that directly affect our town.  Whatever the topic, we aim to keep residents informed when making accurate decisions about our future. We are transparent about who we are and our mission. 

Our goal is to create a space where residents can access reliable information, ask questions, and get transparent accurate information without bias. In today’s fast-paced environment with the proliferation of information without attribution or accuracy, it's more important than ever to have a trusted source for news and updates that impact us all. We believe that an informed community is a stronger community, and we’re excited to be part of that mission.

Join us as we build a platform where truth, transparency, and community come together to keep **Weston** thriving. Let's stay connected! www.engageweston.com

We want to hear from you. Please feel free to email us at info@engageweston.com with comments, suggestions, or a request to be added to our mailing list.

To a Strong Weston,

Alan Day
