Dear Neighbors,

Town Meeting is **Tuesday, March 12 at 7:00 PM** at Weston High School. There are only three articles on the warrant — this meeting will likely be **shorter than others**, but **your vote is critical**.

Below are recommendations from Engage Weston on how to vote on each article and why:

**Vote YES on Article 1 – The Sites**  
The engineering firm, after extensive analysis and input from abutters, identified these sites as the best locations from both an engineering and financial perspective. (This requires a 2/3s vote.  Every vote counts!)

**Vote YES on Article 2 – The Height**  
The zoning bylaw change will only apply to the proposed sites, and any antennas will be restricted to Town use only. (This requires a 2/3s vote.  Every vote counts!)

**Vote YES on Article 3 – Motion 1 (Funding)**  
Authorizes $2M from Free Cash to continue the design process.  Majority vote.

**Vote YES on Article 3 – Motion 2 (Funding)**  
Authorizes the remaining funds to complete the project ($2M from Free Cash and ~$37M in borrowing. This requires a 2/3s vote). Why now – and not later at a following meeting?
- **Secures eligibility** for low-interest state loans for all or part of the cost.
- **Authorizes borrowing if and when needed** — permission, not immediate debt.
- **Shows commitment** to avoid $4–5M in state-mandated repairs to aging tanks.
- **Strengthens contractor interest** — the best contractors will not bid unless the project is fully funded.
- **Avoids repeated Town Meeting debates** — let's use our time and energy wisely and not go through this again!
