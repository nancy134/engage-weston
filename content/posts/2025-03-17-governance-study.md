#### Public Hearing on the Select Board 3v5 Question 
On Thursday, March 27th, the Town Governance Study Committee will be hosting a public hearing to discuss the question of increasing Weston's Select Board from three members to five. The committee has been researching this question ahead of other issues within its charge and an article will be included in the May Annual Town Meeting warrant.

The hybrid meeting on the 27th will be held at the Weston Police Station at 7pm. The meeting link will be provided on the hearing agenda. During the meeting, the committee will present its research to date. Resident discussion regarding this question will provide additional information for the committee before it makes its recommendation.

The Select Board charged the Town Governance Study Committee to research this potential change to Weston's executive branch, as well as other aspects of Weston's government. This was in order to provide full information to all registered voters after an advisory Citizens' Petition passed at the 2022 Annual Town Meeting. If the article in May passes, a ballot vote will also required before the increase can occur.
