This is a letter from Harvy Boshart, Chair of the Governance Study Committee regarding their analysis of the issue of expansion of the Select Board from 3 to 5 members.

We are not taking a stand on this issue, but believe that voters should have all the information available about this issue and not only opinions in opposition to the report.

The full report can be found on the Town's website at:

#### Letter to the Editor
April 27, 2025

To the Editor:  
The Town Governance Study Committee (TGSC) has recently concluded its in-depth review of whether Weston’s Select Board should expand from three to five members. This important study, initiated by a non-binding citizens' petition at the 2022 Annual Town Meeting, spanned more than a year and involved extensive research, public input, and a thorough examination of governance practices across Massachusetts towns.

After this comprehensive process, the TGSC voted unanimously (5-0, with one abstention) not to recommend expanding the Select Board at this time. This decision rests on several key findings, shaped by both Weston’s unique characteristics and broader lessons from other communities:

* Low Civic Participation: Voter turnout in Weston averages just 13.5% for Town Elections, and only 5.5% of registered voters attend Annual Town Meetings. Between 2014 and 2025, only 45% of Select Board races were contested. These numbers reflect limited public engagement—raising concerns about whether there is enough interest to support additional board members.

* Volunteer Shortages: Town officials consistently report difficulties filling both elected and appointed positions. Adding two more seats to the Select Board could further strain an already limited pool of volunteers. Rather than expanding leadership positions, the TGSC recommends redoubling efforts to strengthen volunteer outreach and engagement.

* Mixed Outcomes in Other Towns: While 82% of similarly sized Massachusetts towns have five-member boards, many are in counties with different regional complexities (from industry, tourism, agriculture, etc. to name a few) and growth patterns making it difficult to compare to an established bedroom community. The TGSC found no clear link between board size and population growth, density or the strength of a town administrator. In fact, interviews and studies revealed that larger boards often experience longer meetings, more internal conflict, increased strain on Town Manager offices, and minimal gains in decision-making efficiency. Some towns also reported higher rates of Open Meeting Law violations and public records requests following expansion. Further confusing, it was determined that most of the towns with five Select Board members moved to a town manager form of government later on.

* Transparency Concerns: A five-member board would allow any two members to discuss town business privately without violating the Open Meeting Law—something not possible with a three-member board. It would be possible for any one member to have conversations on town matters with the other board members individually out of public discussion. While some see this as a practical advantage, the TGSC views it as a potential risk to Weston’s tradition of open, public deliberation.

* Stable Population: Weston’s population has remained stable, growing only modestly from 11,555 in 2000 to 11,718 in 2025. Regional forecasts predict no significant growth through 2050. Without substantial population increase, there is no pressing need to expand the board.

* Strong Existing Governance Structure: Since 2000, Weston has operated under a professional Town Manager system, delegating daily operations to trained staff. This model reduces the Select Board’s operational burden and allows members to focus strategically, further lessening the need for additional board members. The Select Board has a longstanding policy for a rotating chair in order to provide balance on the board and having everyone serve as chair. This would not be possible under a five member board.

The TGSC firmly believes that changes to a town’s government should be driven by local needs—not simply by trends elsewhere.

Instead of expanding the board, the committee urges Weston to:
* Improve communication and outreach to residents
* Strengthen volunteer recruitment
* Monitor civic engagement trends over time
* Reconsider board size only if substantial future changes warrant it

Importantly, through resident surveys, two public hearings, and interviews with neighboring towns, the TGSC has helped bring essential information to light. Whether one supports or opposes expanding the Select Board, we can all agree that Weston is now far better informed than when this conversation began. The committee’s work has laid the groundwork for a more thoughtful and informed debate at Town Meeting.

The question of whether to expand the Select Board will come before voters at the 2025 Annual Town Meeting. I encourage every resident to review the TGSC’s full report, available on the town website, and to attend Town Meeting on May 5th at 7 p.m.

Regardless of where we stand individually, the TGSC’s work stands as an example of good governance: thorough, transparent, and resident-centered. Now, it’s up to us—to listen, reflect, and make our voices heard.

Sincerely,  
Harvey Boshart  
On Behalf of the Town Governance Study Committee
